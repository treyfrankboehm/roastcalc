# roastcalc

scrape.py is used to scrape the data from the Google Sheets and store it in the form of CSV files.

calc.py takes those CSV files and looks at them to determine how much of each coffee to roast. This takes into account how much coffee we want on the shelves, how much was ordered, and the average percent loss for past roasts.
